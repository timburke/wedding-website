A walk up and down Castro Street in Downtown Mountain View will give you LOTS of options for Asian, Mediterranean, Latin and American cuisine (check out Ephesus, Crepevine, Sakoon, Oren's Hummus, Agave.) If you're looking for happy hours with good small plate options, we highly recommend Doppio Zero (160 Castro St) and Cascal (400 Castro St). In addition to the food, Tea Era (271 Castro St) is our go-to boba tea place (tiny store, so plan to take a walk or sit outside) and Gelato Classico (241-B Castro St) is an old favourite.

If you want to venture further than the Palo Alto/Mountain View area, we have recommendations for downtown Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and San Francisco as well. Let us know... we'll make you more lists of recommendations.
