<p>
We appreciate that a lot of our guests are visiting from out of town, and we would like to maximize our chances to spend time with everyone! In addition to the day of wedding ceremonies, we have a couple of other activities planned…

<p>If you’re in town by Friday night, come out for drinks with us in downtown Mountain View! We’ll meet at 9pm and go out to the bars on Castro Street (which is about 3 miles away from the hotels we’ve recommended). 
Check back for an update on where to meet - we’ll post a bar and address a few days beforehand.</p>

	        <h2>Wedding Ceremonies &amp; Reception</h2>

We will have two wedding ceremonies followed by a reception and dancing, as follows:<br>
        2:00pm     Indian wedding ceremony <br>
		3:00pm    Snacks &amp; lawn games <br>
        4:00pm     American wedding ceremony<br>
        5:00pm     Cocktail hour &amp; lawn games<br>
        6:00pm     Dinner reception<br>
        8:00pm     Dancing<br>
        10:30pm    Guests retire<br>

        <h3>Attire</h3>
        Semiformal for a daytime event (think “casual cocktail attire” or “business casual”). Please keep in mind that we will be outdoors on a summer afternoon. Since we will be celebrating in both our cultural traditions, please feel free to dress in Indian or Western attire!

        <h3>Location</h3>
        All of our events on the day of the wedding will take place at the Rengstorff House. Please refer to the “Venue” tab above for more information on the location, as well as considerations such as parking and weather.

            <h2>Picnic Brunch</h2>
            If you are still in town on Sunday morning, please join us for an informal picnic brunch at a local park (exact location TBA). In addition to a light brunch spread, we’ll have a frisbee and soccer ball out. There is no schedule for this morning - it’s just a chance to enjoy the park on a sunny summer morning and for us to spend a little more time with our out-of-town guests before they leave.
