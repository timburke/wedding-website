	        <h2>Location</h2>
				<p>Rengstorff House is located about a 10 minute drive from downtown Mountain View, quite near the Google corporate campus.  There are not good public transit options to get there however so renting a car or carpooling with someone else are the best ways to get there.</p>

## Things to Keep In Mind

- The venue is entirely outdoors with the wedding and reception starting in mid-afternoon through the evening.  California evenings can get a bit chilly so guests should bring a light evening jacket.  Weather during the day should be expected to be around 80 degrees and sunny.  There will be plenty of water and soft drinks provided throughout so that people stay hydrated.

- There is limited parking directly at the Rengstorff House, and guests are advised to carpool. There is additional parking at the golf course to one side of the house and the waterfront restaurant on the other side of the house. Please view the map above for the specific locations and distances.
