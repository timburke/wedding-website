The wedding and reception will be located at the historic Rengstorff House located in Moutain View.  Rengstorff House was built in 1864 and is the oldest house in Mountain View.  It is surrounded on three sides by beautiful green spaces and located in the heart of Shoreline Park.  

The wedding will take place entirely outdoors with events on all three sides of the Rengstorff House, followed by a reception and dinner in a shaded garden area to the right of the house.

Rengstorff House is located about a 10 minute drive from downtown Mountain View, quite near the Google corporate campus.  There are not good public transit options to get there however so renting a car or carpooling with someone else are the best ways to get there.
