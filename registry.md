Your presence at our wedding celebration is truly all the gift we could ask for. Besides, over the years we have both accumulated enough housewares and kitchen gadgets to fill a (moderately sized) Bay Area apartment. As such, we donâ€™t have a wedding registry. 

For guests who wish to get us gifts, please contact us (timandsaumya@gmail.com), Barbara Burke (bburke@pbdinc.net) or Padmini Sankaran (padsan04@gmail.com) for details. We ask that guests please not bring boxed gifts.
