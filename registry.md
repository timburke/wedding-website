Your presence at our wedding celebration is truly all the gift we could ask for. Besides, over the years we have both accumulated enough housewares and kitchen gadgets to fill a (moderately sized) Bay Area apartment. 

As such, we donâ€™t have a wedding registry, and we ask that guests please not bring any boxed gifts.
