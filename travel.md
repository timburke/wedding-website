All of our wedding events take place on the Peninsula of the San Francisco Bay Area between the towns of Mountain View (where Google is located) and Palo Alto (where Stanford is located).  This is close to San Francisco but still about 45 minutes to an hour drive away.  Staying in San Francisco is not recommended as a convenient option.  We have two hotel blocks very close to our venue for people to stay in if they want.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The map embedded to the right shows our venue in green, hotels in blue and nearby airports in red.</span>

San Francisco is in the upper left-hand corner.  Oakland is in the upper right-hand corner and San Jose is in the lower right-hand corner.

There are three airports serving the Bay Area: San Francisco International, San Jose and Oakland.  San Jose and San Francisco are both google choices to fly into.  San Jose is slightly closer to the venue but both are about 20-30 minutes away driving assuming you are not arriving at rush hour on a week day (7-10am, 3-7pm).  There is not a good public transit option to get to either our venue or hotels, so renting a car is the best option.  If you don't want to rent a car, an Uber from SFO to our hotel blocks should cost about $35 using UberPool.

# Public Transit Options

In general there is decent public transit in the Bay Area.  Unfortuntely, none of it will directly help you get from the airport to your hotel near our Venue.  It can be very useful for exploring the rest of the Bay Area, though.  There are three main systems: <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a>, <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> and <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/transit">MUNI</a>.  Caltrain is a North-South rail line that connects San Jose to San Francisco.  BART is a subway line that runs through San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland.  It does not reach all the way down the peninsula near our hotels though so you need to take Caltrain to a BART connection and then take BART wherever you want to go.  MUNI is a subway system that just serves San Franicsco.
